I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Economics. I'm interested in Behavioral Economics, Economic Networks, Complexity, Machine Learning and AI. I'm looking forward to working on multi-agent reinforcement learning model for better economic simulation, for more details see [this work](https://blog.einstein.ai/the-ai-economist/#:~:text=The%20AI%20Economist%20is%20a,collectively%20learning%20using%20reinforcement%20learning.). AI tutor with high level of personalization is me field of interest right now.

I'm an online learning addict and have a very broad interest. I have a map where I organize everything that I'm interested in, and planning to learn more about, you can have a look at [here](https://kumu.io/datnguyen/graph#tree-of-knowledge) if you are interested.

I love Graphs.
