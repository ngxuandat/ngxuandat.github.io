title: How to study physics as IT student
---

I have always been fascinated with Physics, and find myself applying basic models of Physics in my thinking all the time. Surprisingly, the things that I learned from Physics and Chemistry classes during Junior High have been serving me very well, daily and till these days. After gotten in to college, I thought I could set sometimes for Physics. I attempted Walter Lewin's courses several times yet never had the time to finish. 

Fortunately, an educator in Vietnam already came up with a Physics curriculum for CS majors. Here are the main notes I took from his blog post written in Vietnamese. 

Learning Physics even if you are a CS major will be beneficial because:
- IT is huge right now and you probably don't have time for too much unnecessary knowledge.
- Working with computers means that naturally you will have the habit to self-study a lot when needed.  
- Combining Physics ideas/concept with programming, data crunching can generates good chunks of start-up ideas.
- By learning basic Physics ideas and concepts, you will know what to look up for when needed. 
- Many Physics ideas are useful when working IoT, Cyber Physical System, Graphics, Signal Analysis, Microcontroller, Quantum Computing and Cryptography, etc.


You don't need to study Physics the traditional way(which is almost impossible if you are also majoring CS), just focus on the core ideas, concepts and their applications. After the having a grasp of the basics, you can try to focus more on the topics that you are interested in. Moreover, the following curriculum should be sufficient for giving you a decent Physics foundation, which will help you grasp the big picture of Physics, while providing you with enough foundational knowledge to help you be open to new computing technology(that are deeply Physics) like Quantum Computing or Brain Simulation.

I'll try to include the materials, but for now I'll just leave it here. (May 10 2023)
