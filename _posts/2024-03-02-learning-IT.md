# There are three path. You can take all of them, each of them are foundational for the next. Consider how much time you want to spend based on what you want to achieve learning these.

## Some recommendations:

- Deviation from these suggested paths is highly recommended.
- Remember to spare sometimes for yourself to try implementing what you have learn.
- Stay away from the Tutorial Hell.

## Here are the what you can expect to achieve for each path:

### Path A: making decent amount working as a free-lance programmer
### Path B: working as a programmer as your main job
### Path C: be able to understand and take advantages of the hottest trends in the field, build a venture

## Path A
- Learn basic programming using [C](https://venkivasamsetti.github.io/ebookworm.github.io/Books/cse/C%20Programming%20Language%20(2nd%20Edition).pdf) or Python (1 month)
    - Just the basic is enough
    - Focus on understanding: variables-pointers/memory address, data communication, loop-conditional statement
    - Learn UI design, Data base, String manipulation
- Learn some basic about OS, and computer architecture. (2 weeks reading, 2 weeks practicing implementing)
- SQL and data base (1 week reading, 1 week implementing)

## Path B
*Like Path A but cut the steps the things that you think won’t be necessary.*

- Install, config and dive deep into an open-source social network(like [mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon)) and e-commerce platform([spree](https://github.com/spree/spree)), read and code on your own.
- Choose to learn 1 of these:
    - ML, AI and Blockchain
    - [Andre Kapathy’s Github](https://github.com/karpathy?tab=repositories)
    - Read and play around with [Linux Source code](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), socket programming.


## Path C
*Like B but with some additions*

- Learn ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning):
    - Aim for for certification from a close-source ERP
        - Typically from Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle (NetSuite) or SAP.

Endnote: I think there are still quite a lot more other topics like the Algorithms and Data Structure rabbit hole. I still can’t figure it out how to put those in each path without making them feel so daunting. Feel free to discuss your thoughts.

Most of these I learned from [Mr. Aiviet Nguyen](https://www.facebook.com/aiviet.nguyen.9) and some parts of the blog is the direct translation of his writings in Vietnamese.
